I'm currently striving forward to become a still junior full-stack software engineer but with solid foundations and an ability to learn, and... I do enjoy it quite much ! <br/><br>

After teaching Classics for three years, I'm currently learning programming at *Ada Tech School*, a dev school where you learn by doing. No classes, but a written curriculum, available mentors, and many two-week group projects and frequent problem-solving.

**I've begun the 9-month formation in October, 2021 and am now <u>looking for a one-year internship/apprenticeship starting in June, 2022</u> or in the following months.**

Apart from the more grounded skills I've been confident enough to put in the badges up there, I've also done some forays in functional programming with Elm, a front-end-oriented FP language, dabbled in many languages and concepts through my formation (coding a chrome extension doing API calls and styling the received data / a game in PICO-8 - a fantasy console integrating many tools for pixel-art, music, mapping, where you code in Lua / refactoring and completing a pre-existing PHP social network, thus using XAMPP and getting more familiar with the use of a relational database (MariaDB) / coding from scratch a mock e-commerce website to sell second-hand furniture with React, Django and a database / coding an iOS app in Swift for listing SurfSpots from an existing API, allowing navigation by categories, and displaying a detailed view with an interactive map / and then implementing our own API for this same project using Go and a database.)

Every Friday is work-on-what-you-want day at Ada Tech School. I usually do some katas but above all work on The Odin Project curriculum, a very solid full-stack web curriculum to learn efficient programming and autonomous problem-solving with progressively more ambitious projects. A shout-out to this amazing open-source endeavour !
